version 5.5 - 15.02.2022

+ included openmp support on linux

version 5 - 30.07.2021

+ using jit for generating sinograms / gradients. 
  -> lucious memory consumption is gone (now works with slice > 1000 pixels)
  -> speed up of iteration by around factor of 3
     numsim, Ndet=180, mr=1, factr=1e9, from 67s -> 16s
+ cleaned up iterlib and cut out around 40% of the lines.
+ radon transform and grad radon functions are now in one function for easier maintancance

version 4 - 

+ improved documentation of gradradon & graddiffradon in iterlib

version 3 - 24.04.2019

+ new directory structure
  This means that the scripts need to kow the path to the iterlib.py library.
  You can do this by either using:
	import sys
	sys.path.append('../libs/')
	import iterlib
  or by setting the path to iterlib in spyder under:
	tools -> PYTHONPATH manager -> add appropriate path to ./libs/
+ fixed minor bugs in examples/numsim.py
+ fixed minor bugs in examples/fastspheres.py

version 2 - 10.04.2019

+ minor bug fixes

version 1 - 03.04.2019

+ first version of the iteration library.
